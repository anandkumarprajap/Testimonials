## overview
A testimonials project in a React app is a web-based application designed to showcase user or client feedback in an interactive and visually appealing way. The project typically includes a series of testimonial cards that display quotes, client names, and possibly images. These testimonials are often organized in a slider or grid format, allowing users to easily browse through them.
